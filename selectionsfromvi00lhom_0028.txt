xxii SUGGESTIONS To THE STUDENT

J. CUM CLAUSES

The temporal, causal, and concessive uses of cum have already
been given separately. Cum was originally a temporal conjunc-
tion. From the tempora] idea were developed its other meanings.
So the English when frequently contains the ideas of time and
cause, or time and concession combined, and while also is fre-
quently at once temporal and concessive. So cum also may repre-
sent these ideas in combination as well as separately. In many
caseS, indeed, it is difficult, if not impossible, to decide which
meaning is more prominent: cf.

Cum (when and since) lupa saepius ad parvulos . . reverteretur, I, 163
His artibus cum (when and althouyh) Hannibalem Fabius . . clau-
sisset, ille . . se expedivit, XIX, 31.

K„ THE ABLATIVE ABSOLUTE

1. Forum—The ablative absolute consists usually of a noun
and a participle. The participle is generally passive, but often
active: Εὸ regnante, IV, 33 relabente flumine, Ι, 9.

2. Often, however, the ablative absolute consists of a noun and
adjective, or of two nouns, or a noun and pronoun. In such cases
there is an ellipsis of the lost present participle of sum:

magnei g16ria belli, IV, 753 pari fere 6rn5t1'1, X, 63 Appic‘> iudice, XII,
153 Valeri& et Coss& consulibus, XIV, l.

T1ME3 compare Temporal Clauses, G- 1, 2, and 5.

puls6 fratre, regnavit, I, 33 Ea re cbgnitfi, parvulos . . abiecit in Tibe-
rim, Ι, 5; 31111Ξ11ῑῐ3 pastoribus, Albam properavit, I, 25.
