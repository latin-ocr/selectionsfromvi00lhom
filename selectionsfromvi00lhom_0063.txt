decemviri creati sunt, qui3 adlatas e Graecia leges populo pro-
ponerent* Duodecim⁵ tabulis6 eae sunt perscriptae. Ceterum
decemviri⁷ sua8 ipsorum insolentia in exitium acti sunt. Nam
smus exiis Appius Claudius virginem plebeiam adamavit. Quam⁹

bus ¹⁰ subornavit, qui eam 11111 servitutem deposcere& facile vic-
turum ¹3 se speram, cum ipse esset et accusator et iudex, Lucius

virgini ¹⁴ venienti in Forum (namque ibi in tabernis litterarum 1⁵

sequi se iubet3 ni faciat‚¹⁶ minatur se Vi abstracturum. Pavida
puella Π stupente‚¹⁷ ad clamorem nutricis fit concursus. Itaque cum
ille puellam vi non posset abducere, eain vocat in ius, ipso

civitas in Foro exspectatione erecta stabat. Virginius statim in
Forum lacrimabundus et civium opem implorans filiam suam
