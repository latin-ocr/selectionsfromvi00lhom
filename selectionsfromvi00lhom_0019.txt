SUGGESTIONS TO THE STUDENT xiii

order, even if not very common, is none the less intelligible. So
the sentence ut . . . fecit discussed above may be translated almost
exactly in the Latin order.

LATIN COMPOSITION

Its Value.—An exercise which is very practical and helpful‚ ,
and which may also become extremely delightful, is the rendering
into Latin of English sentences based upon that portion of the
Latin text which has already been carefully studied. This exer-
cise is helpful, because it calls upon us to put into practice the
knowledge which we have acquired in reading3 it may become
delightful because it shows us accurately the measure of our
advance and thus affords us the pleasure which comes from the
feeling that one is making sure progress in a given line of study.

Essentials. - To write Latin 'well one needs precisely the things
which we found necessary in reading (page ix). The words and
constructions required in the sentences for translation given on
pages 112 to 129 are illustrated by the corresponding pages of the
Latin text. The pupil should always endeavor to recall the word,
inflectional form, phrase, or construction for himself before refer-
ring to his text or to his grammar. In other words, he should
make the exercise one of thought rather than of inere mechanical
copying from a printed model.

The Object. -We read the Latin text in order to understand
the thoughts of the writer. So in turning English sentences into
Latin our chief object is to clothe the tlzougyhts which such sen-
tences convey in proper Latin dress, not merely to substitute
Latin words for English words. Every language has its own
peculiar expressions, which are called z’dz'oms. Such expressions
can never be literally translated from one language into another.
Hence in attempting to turn an English sentence into Latin,
we must begin by noting carefully the thought which it expresses,
