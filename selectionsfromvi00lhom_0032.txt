5. QUESTIONS IN INDIRECT Drsooorzsss.

All Questions of the Direct Discourse, on passing into the Indi-
rect, fall into the subjunctive mood, because they are in reality
dependent on a verb of asking. No example of a question in
formal indirect discourse occurs in the selections contained in this
book. Indirect questions (cf. p. 3, n. 2), however, fall under this
general head as giving some one's thoughts without quoting his
exact words.

6. COMMANDS IN INDIRECT DISCOURSE.

All Commands of the Direct Discourse, on passing into the
Indirect, fall into the subjunctive, because they are in reality
dependent on some verb like imperavit, to be supplied in
thought:

ΝὸΙῑ gravari te spectandum praebere), satis constat Sullam . .
proclamasse, vincerent, dummodo scirent, XXVII, 12-15 (direct
form, Vincite, dummodo sciatis).

7. SUBORDINATE CLAUSES IN INDIRECT DISCOURSE.
All Subordinate Clauses of the Indirect Discourse have their
verbs in the subjunctive mood:

Tatius . . Tarpeiae optionem muneris dedit, si . . perduxisset, H, 19-
21 (direct form, do or dabo optionem 111s111e1·is,si . . perduxeris:
see note); Illa petiit quod gererent, Π, 21 (direct form, Peto quod
. . geritis).
