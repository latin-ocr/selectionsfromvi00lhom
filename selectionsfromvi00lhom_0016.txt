x SUGGESTIONS TO THE STUDENT

It is useful also to group together in memory words derived
from the same stem, (3.9. cano, cantus; certo, certdmfflz,· diaco, duoeg
reqc‘), reso, remu-Q· caedo, caedes. A specially interesting study
consists in noting the English words which go back to Latin
originals. From various causes a large part of our English
vocabulary is borrowed from Latin. Cf. donate with ᾱόηό and
donum, chcicl with Zz‘coe, reqem with 7⁴&oe and reqc').

Finally, it will be found very helpful constantly to read Latin
aloud, for thus the ear will help the eye and words will have
meaning when heard as well as when seen. lndeed, we ought to
use our ears far more than our eyes in acquiring a Latin vocabu-
lary, in order that Latin words, when heard, shall suggest at once
to our minds the same pictures which they suggested to the minds
of Roman boys,

Inflections and Syntax. -It is not enough, however, to be
familiar with the meanings of individual words, however many
we may succeed in mastering. We must possess a knowledge
also of inflections, ele. of the declensions and conjugations, which
tell us how individual words may be altered in form in order to
express different relations to other words, and of syntaoe, which
tells us how words are combined together into sentences. A
knowledge of inflections and an understanding of syntax are the
tools by which we arrive at the meaning of sentences as a whole.
As the wise workman uses the best and most efficient tools, so one
who undertakes to read Latin with speed and pleasure must make
his mastery of inflections and syntax as complete as possible. It
is assumed that students of this book have already fiad some drill
in the commoner inflections. The principles of syntax can best be
studied as they occur in actual reading. The commonest, and
therefore most important, are discussed in the notes and illus-
trated by appropriate references to the grammars in common use
and by the tables of constructions on pages xvi to xxvi. A very
practical way of fixing the principles of syntax firmly in mind is
