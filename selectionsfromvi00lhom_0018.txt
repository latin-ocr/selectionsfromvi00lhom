xii SUGGESTIONS To THE STUDENT

always good reason for it. It is our task at the outset‚ as it soon
will be our pleasure, to determine just what this reason is.

Now this freer order 01 words in the Latin sentence is rendered
possible by the fact that Latin possesses an elaborate infiectional
system, whereas English does not. Note, however, that one
familiar with Latin declensions would know at once that in the
first sentence discussed above Proca was actor (cle. subject),
and Numitor and Amulius acted upon (120. object). So in the
sentence ut . . . jecit it is clear that Amulius is the actor and
that Rhea Silvia is acted upon. Thus the inflectional system
serves to relieve, in part at least, the very difficulty which it
creates.

How to Read. — By far the best way 101 1110 beginner to make
himself familiar with the Latin order and its meaning is to
make a practice from the very outset of readinq tlte sentence aloud
from beqinniny to end before (attemptiny to translate at all. If the
meaning is not clear at once, a repetition 01 311011 reading will
often serve to make it clear, provided the student knows the 10100

seek the aid 01 1110 vocabulary or the notes. Then let him read the
sentence once more aloud, slowly and carefully. He should not,
however, look into either vocabulary or notes until 110 has read
the Latin through at least once. Progress at first will necessarily
be slow, but it will be sure. By every page read in the manner

and more intelligence and pleasure the pages that remain. Be-

lish, word after word, in 1110 order in which it is written, and
precisely as a Roman boy 1800 years ago read his Latin story or
poem. He will gain further the advantage 01 training his ear as
well as his eye and of making it do its fair share 01 1110 work. In
translating, too, it will be wise to follow as closely as possible the
Latin order. 011011 11 will be found that the resulting English
