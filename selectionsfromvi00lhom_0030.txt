xxiv SUGGESTIONS TO THE STUDENT

much larger variety of meanings. The use of the participle tends
to produce brevity of expression. Thus the Latin participle may
be equivalent to

1. A RELATIVE CLAUSE:

raptae mulieres, II, 353 Romanus . . male sustinentem (= qui male
sustinebat) arma Curiatium confi-cit, IV, ‘293 ab lanio cultro adrepto
(with a knife which Ite cauylzt up from a butcher’s stall), XII, 243
volentibus (= eis qui volebant) consulere se de ifire praebuit,
XIII, 97.

2. Α CAUSAL CLAUSE:
necessitate compulsus indicavit, Ι, ‘243 nomina mutare nou potuit deter-
ritus . . Navii auctoritate, VI, 163 Hoc terrore ceteri adacti 116-
mina promptius dederuut, XV, 25.

3. Α CONCESSIVE CLAUSE:

victus (though beaten) crucis supplicium effugit, XVI, 30.

4. Latin often uses a perfect passive participle in agreement
with a noun, where, judging from English usage, we should
expect a noun with a liiniting genitive:

ob virgines raptas (on account of the seizure of the maidens), II, 143
Anno trecentesimo ab urbe condita] (from the founding] ofthe city),
XII, 1.

5. English is fond of coorclinated verbs, that is, verbs in exactly
the same moocl, tense, and construction, eq. ‘They took the ass
and saddled him.⁷ Latin, however, objects to such constructions,
and prefers to replace the former of the two verbs by some
other form of expression, eq. a passive or deponent participle.
We have to notice here two classes of sentences:

(a) Such sentences as fulmine ictum cssnflagrasse, IV, 74, which
= fulmine ictum esse et conflagrasse, tle. ‘ he was struck by light-
ning ancl burnecz,’ etc.

(b) such sentences as the following: parvulos alveo impositos
