UPON the reviving perception οξ the true scope οξ Latin teach-
ing has followed a return to some οξ the methods of former times,

⁴ which, with all their faults, were yet inibued with the true spirit

οξ the Classics. Since for many years the study of Latin lay in
bondage to the spirit which regarded the language merely as a
corpus vile for grammatical dissection, and ignored the rich litera-
ture lying beyond the classical trinity οξ authors, it is not surpris-
ing that it fellvinto disfavor as unsuited to the requirements οξ
the times. The revival upon which the study has now entered is
due largely to a recognition οξ the fact that mental culture rather
than mere mental training is its true aim, and that, with this aim
kept steadily in view, thestudy οξ Latin is not a barren waste οξ
time and energy, but a most potent agency in securing that broad
and sympathetic culture which must ever ,remain the mark οξ the
educated man. The results οξ classical- study most valuable
to the character are surely not to be found in the ability, usually
lost- after a few years, to recite paradigms faultlessly, to give
the principal parts οξ verbs, and to enumerate the various kinds οξ
cum-constructions and the subdivisions οξ the ablative. Οξ far
greater worth are the mental breadth, and sympathy, the weaken-
ing οξ prejudice and Philistinism, ‘and the increased power οξ
entering into higher forms οξ enjoyment which must inevitably
fiow from the study οξ the life οξ a great people as revealed in its

literature and art. , ,
