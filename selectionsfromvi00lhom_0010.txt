iv PREFACE

This conception of the sphere 01 Latin study has brought with
it some niodifications of the initia] steps and a return to some 01
1110 texts 111 1130 fifty years since. In the traditional sequence 01
authors, and particularly in the selection of a purely military
work as the means by which to introduce the student 10 1110 1311-
guage, the entrance into the fields of Latin literature has 110-
quently been made 30 distasteful as to destroy the desire for
further exploration. More attractive paths, however, are opening
10 1110 beginner3 and 01 111030 1110 Viri Romae offers in a notable
degree material of real interest to the young, and, from the very
outset, gives a foretaste 01 1110 0011101113 01 1110 literature.

The history of this work is 01 interest, as showing an early
recognition 01 1110 correctness 01 1110 standpoint to which we are
now returning. It was compiled by a Professor 01 1110 University
01 Î¡3113, Charles Francois Lhomond, who lived from 1727 10 17 94,
and enjoyed an enviable reputation 33 3 successful teacher, espe-
cially 01 younger pupils. His experience taught him the need 01
an introductory text combining interest 01 story with simplicity
of style. The best proof 01 1110 excellence 01 1113 work is the fact
that it has ever since remained a favorite with teachers of Latin.
The material is taken from the works 01 various authors, chiefly
Livy and Eutropius, but was simplified by Lhomond in vocabu-
lary and construction wherever necessary to fit it to the require-
ments 01 beginners. As its title indicates, it (leals with the early
stories 01 Rome, so fascinating in any dress to the young, and it 13

The present edition has been prepared with reference to the
difficulties most likely 10 011110311333 1110 young 11111111 31 1110 0111301
01 1110 new study. One 01 1110 111031 perplexing of these difficul-
ties is the inability to discover in 311 alphabetical vocabulary the
infiected forms encountered in the text. This is met, in part at
least, by giving in 1131103 111 the footnotes the vocabulary form of
verbs not easily recognizable. For a similar reason grammatical
