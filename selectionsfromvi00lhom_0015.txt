SUGGESTIONS TO THE STUDENT

„fflffloffim

To read Latin quickly and intelligently‚ and to enjoy the read-
ing properly, we must possess (1) a vocabulary‚ 226. a collection of
Latin words with whose meanings‚ whether used singly or in
combination‚ we are thoroughly familiam (2) a knowledge of the
inflectional system of the language, zle. its declensions and conju-
gations3 (3) a knowledge of its syntax3 and (4) a knowledge of
the plan upon which the Latin sentence is constructed, or, in
other words, we must be able to overcome the difficulties arising
out of the peculiar order of the words and clauses that form a
Latin sentence.

Vocabulary.—VVords are the material out of which sentences
are constructed. Hence it is of prime importance to know their
meanings. The best way, in fact the only way, to acquire a
vocabulary‚ is by constant reading, and by noting carefully the
force of individua] words as they occur. It soon becomes evident
that certain words are very frequently used, especially verbs
which denote actions that have to do with everyday life, such as
dico, eo, facio, habeo, venio, sum, and their compounds. These at
least must be mastered at the very outset. It is worth while to
notice what prefixes are used in forming compound verbs, and the
modifications of meaning which they produce. If the force of
the simple verb is mastered, a little practice will enable the stu-
dent to detect at sight the meaning of any of its compormds

without reference to any dictionary.
