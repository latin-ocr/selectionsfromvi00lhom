TABLES OF CONsTRUo'rIONs

The following tables have been prepared for the purpose of
affording the pupil material for study and comparison, by group-
ing together under appropriate heads examples of certain eon-
structions as they actually occur in this book. It is expected
that they will be helpful to the student in two ways· (1) by sup-
plementing and illustrating the notes, and (2) by affording him
guides which 116 may follow in his writing 61 Latin. No attempt
whatever has been made to include under any given head all the
examplesthat are to be found in the text. The pupil will find it
both interesting and instructive to add to the lists himself as he
finds new instances in his own reading.
