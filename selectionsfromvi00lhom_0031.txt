M. INDIRECT DISCOURSE

1. INDIRECT DISCOURSE DEFINED. — The terms Direct Dis-
course and Inclz‘rect Dz‘sconrse denote the two distinct ways in
which a writer may quote the statement or represent the thought
of another person. If the writer gives the exact words in which
the statement was made, or in which the thought was formulated
(if put into words at all), he is said to use the direct discourse.
If, on the other hand, he gives merely the substance or the gist of
his own or another-'s statements or thoughts, he is said to use the
inclz'rect discourse. In Latin, as in English, the indirect discourse
15 more common than the direct.

2. In passing from the direct discourse to the indirect, numer·
ous changes become necessary. These may, however, be readily
grouped under two heads: (a) those which occur in principal
clauses, and (b) those which occur in subordinate clauses.

3. CHANGEs IN PRINCIPAL CLAUSEs.—Principal clauses may
be declarative, interrogative, or imperative ; that is, they may make
a statement, ask a question, or give expression to a command. We
thus have to consider three forms of principal clauses: (α) State-
ments, (b) Questions, (c) Commands.

4. STATEMENTS IN INDIRECT DISCOURSE.

All Statements of the Direct Discourse, on passing into the
[ndirect, fall into the infinitive mood, because they become objects
of verbs of saying:

II, 51 (direct form, visus est a me R6111ulus . . idemque praeci-
pit); proclamabat filiam suam isire caesam esse, IV, 43 (direct
