SUGGESTIONS TO THE STUDENT xj

by frequent translation from English into Latin. It should be
remembered, however, that we study syntax simply because such
study enables us to read and enjoy the great works of Latin
literature.

The Order of Words.— The greatest difficulty that confronts the
student of Latin literature is the fact that the order of the words
in a Latin sentence is widely different from that which he ordi-
narily finds in an English sentence. This difference is due mainly
· to two causes. (1) Every Latin sentence is a kind of word pic-
ture, in which the meaning is developed stroke by stroke, tlte
separate parts being} introduced in the order of their importance.
(2) It is a principle of Latin to keep the meaning in suspense
until the very end, so that the last word completes not only the
form, but also the meaning of the sentence. Both these princi·
ples may be seen at work in lines 1 to 5 of selection Ι, page 1.
Proca naturally stands first, partly because the whole work is a
story of the deeds of men, partly because at this point he is espe-
cially important, as being the reigning king, with power to choose
his own successor. The phrase rect Albanorum very properly fol·
lOWS, as defining the scene of the action. Numitor and Amr-altus
are next mentioned because the Latin loves ,to emphasize con-
trasts of persons. The sense of the whole is not complete till we
reach. the very last word, habuit. In the next sentence Numitori
is first, because now Numitor is more important, as being Proca's
successor. The relative clause qui . . . erat not only states a fact,
but also gives the reason why Proca bequeathed his kingdom
(rcqnum reliquit> to Numitor. So in the words ut . . . fficit, the ut-
clause tells why Amulius performed the act indicated by the
words Rhecwn Silvaram . . . fecit, so that by the time we know what
the act was we know also exactly why it was performed. The
Latin thus pictures the parts of the scene in their true order, for
the motive in every case precedes the act. XVe see therefore that,
however strange at times the Latin order may seem to be, there is
