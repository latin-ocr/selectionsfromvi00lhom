and then consider how the Romans gave expression to that
thought. ’

Choice of Expression.—In Latin, just as in English, it often
happens that the same thought may be expressed in several ways,
which differ greatly in the words used as well as in the form and
expression. In English it is often impossible to give a reason
,101 1116 6110166 01 0116 101111 01 expression in preference to others.
Sometimes the choice is made consciously for the sake of variety,
or because there is a very slight shade of difference in meaning, ——
so slight that we can perhaps feel it, but cannot put it into words:

, sometimes unconsciously, because every one falls into the habit

of using certain phrases and manners of speech with no deeper
reason than the habit. The same is true of Latin writers. Their
various forms of expression have been noted and collected, and we
find them laid down in the grammars as mles. Some of these
expressions are found to be used by the best writers more fre-
quently than others, and these are considered the best models.
But the student must avoid the error of confining himself abso->v
lutely to one iron-bound form because most stress is laid upon it
by the grammars, if he finds other modes of expression in the
writings 01 good authors. By searching out the greatest variety*
01 1011115 111 which an idea may be expressed, by trying to dis-·
cover the differences in meaning between them, and by placing
yourself as far as possible in the writer’s place, you will gain a

ing a single rigid rule and forcing it to fit every case.
