The Noctes Atticae ‹›f Aulus (iellius is a representative work,
since it not only reflects perfectly the nature of the subjects which
engaged the attention of the literary men of the second century A.D.,
but also forcibly depicts the spirit in which their labors were prosecuted.
Of especial interest and value are the numerous quotations from early
writers whose works are no longer extant. For such portions as yet
remain of the oldest Latin literature, we are almost wholly indebted to
quotations by various grammarians. In this connection the obligations
of Latin scholarship to Gellius are far from small. Fully two hundred and
seventy-five authors are mentioned or direetly quoted in his work, while
the number of individual works cited is twice or thrice as large. In
giving these quotations from the older writers, he often adds information
concerning their careers, or their works, and in this way his contribu-
tions to our knowledge of the history of Latin literature is very
valuable. For example, practically all that is known of the life of
Plautus, the greatest comic poet of Rome, is derived from the third
chapter of the third book of the Noctes Atticae.

The commentary gives sufficient assistance to enable such students
to read the selections as rapidly and intelligently as possible, and
without the need of any helps beyond those furnished by the book itself.
The text, in point of language and spelling, is in the main that of
Hertz, as given in his critical edition. Throughout the book all vowels
known to be long have been carefully marked.
