PREFACE v

constructions are, on their first occurrence, explained in simple
language, or their nature briefiy indicated, in order that the stu-
dent may more intelligently consult the grammatica] references
which follow. For purposes of comparison, and as a means of
helping the pupil to form proper habits of study and observation,
Subsequent occurrences are referred to previous instances, or to
the tables of constructions on pages xvi—xxvi.

Although the compiler of the Vm· Romae greatly simplified the
language of his authorities, there yet remain in the early part of
the book many constructions which the beginner is not fitted to
discuss. It is strongly recommended, therefore, that the treat-
ment of the more difficult and complex of these constructions be
postponed to a later period. At the outset the attention of the
pupi] should be centered upon matters of primary importance and
upon the simplest and most common usages, such as the form of
the sentence, the relation of its parts to one another, the signifi-
cance of terminations, and the modes of expressing the constantly
recurring relations of time, place, cause, means, purpose, and
result. Even these should be treated as simply as possible and
with constant regard to English usage. It is the experience of
many teachers that reference to a Latin grammar to explain a
construction possessed by English as well as by Latin frequently
creates a difficulty where the student, if left to his own devices,
would have experienced none.

The notes on matters of Roman custom have been made inten-
tionally full with the aim of adding reality to the stories, and of
inducing the pupil, under the teacher’s guidance, to discover for
himself further details. The use of other accounts, whether in
ancient 'or modern authors, of photographs, plates, and other
graphic aids can not be too strongly encouraged, in accordance
with the dictum of Horace ε ——

Segnius irritant animos demissa per aures
Quam quae sunt oculis subiecta fidelibus.
