Among the few TroJans who escaped after the fall of Troy was Aeneas, the son
of Venus and the hero Anchises. After many wanderings Aeneas reached Italy,
married there Lavinia, the daughter of Latinus, king of the Latins, and founded
a town called Lavinium, from the name of his wife. He was succeeded by his
son Ascanius, who founded a second city, called Alba Longa, and transferred
thither the seat of govermnent. The date traditionally assigned to the capture
of Troy was 1184 B.C. Hence it is clear that Alba Longa was settled more than
400 years before the foundation of Rome in 754 B.C. To fill this gap a list of
fourteen Alban kings, all descendants of Aeneas, was given by the Roman writers.
How Rome itself was founded from Alba Longa is described in the text. It should
be kept constantly in mind that little faith is to be put in these traditional
accounts of Rome's early history, at least as far as details are coneerned. Latin
writers tell us that the oldest records of the city perished in the sack of Rome by
the Gauls in 388 B.C. The first historical work written by a Roman was published
about 215 B.c.‚ more than 500 years after the foundation of the city. Many of
the stories were obviously invented to account for institutions which existed
in the later times, and the traditional narrative is full of inconsistencies and
contradictions.
