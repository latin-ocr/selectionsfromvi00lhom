name from the circumstance that it was
always made of wood and supported on
piles (sublicae). It is this bridge that
figures so largely in Macaulay’s Lays
of Ancient Rome, Horatius, stanzas
xxix. ff.

1 in b're: ‘at the mouth.' The town
Ostia got its name from its position in
§re Tiberis. It was the port of Rome,
and thus attained great importance.
Great harbors were built there in the
days of the Empire, the remains of
which, as well as of the warehouses
built for the storage of merchandise
from abroad. are still visible.

2 Tarquiniis . . . urbe: ‘from Tar-
quinii, a city of Etruria.’ Cf. p. 8,
n. 5. 3 proficiscor. 4 Sc. R5mam:
‘while on his¹ way to Rome.’ The
participle agrees with ei understood,
which is a dat. of separation, or, more
strictly, of disadvantage with sustulit:

or ‘to place assamss rsirsus is unneces—
sary. 9 More often reposto* is followed
by in with the ablative, or the accusa·
tive. 10 sublimis abiit: ‘flew hig-h up
in air and departed.’ 11 caelestium
prodigiorum perita: ‘skilled (in inter-
preting) portonts 'from heaven.' The
Romans regarded the Etruscans as ex-
ceptionally skillsul in such matters.
For the gen„ see 399, I, 2: 218, (ι : 374.
12 regnum ei portendi intellexit: ‘per-
ceived that the sign indicated that he
was to be king) How literally? Ac-
cording to Livy, the significance of the
omen lay iu these facts : It came from a
favorable quarter of the sky (which, to
the Romans, was the east) 3 it concerned
his head, the supreme part of his being3
hence the removal of his cap by the
effigie, the bird of Jupiter, ‘king of gods
and men,' and its restoration, implied
that his cap was to be removed and
replaced by a croton. 13 neuter plural
adjectives‚ used as nouns: ‘an ex·
alted destiny.'
