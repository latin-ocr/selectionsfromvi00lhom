This work gives a representative survey of Latin Literature,
intended to be read in advanced academie or college work, as supple-
mentary to a regular course in Latin Literature, or to be itself the
fundamental work in such a course. The selections range from the
popular songs which antedate written literature, to the Christian hymns
of the third century, covering the early dramatists, historians, orators,
philosophers, the writers of satire and epigram, the lyric and cpic poets‚
the collectors of anecdotes, letter writers, and authors of prose works,
and including other material of a popular nature, such as lampoons,
parodies, epitaphs, advertisements, announcements of ball games‚
theatrical and gladiatorial notices, etc. To each selection is prefixed a
concise account of the author, when known, and of his works, with a
brief bibliography. For convenience in sight reading the text is
provided with a translation of the more difficult words, and is followed
by a fuller commentary of special points of interest.
