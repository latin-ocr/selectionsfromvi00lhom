. The original Latin city comprised only the Palatine and a small portion of the surrounding terri-
tory. The Etruscaus inhabited the Caelian Hill, and extendcd toward the Esquiline. The Sabine
town occupied the Quirinal, which was originally connected with the Capitoline, on which was the
Sabine citadel‚ by a ridge sloping toward the Forum and the Campus Martius. Ancus Marcius added
to the city the Aventine‚ and built a sortress ou the Janiculum. Servius Tullius added the Vimina'l
and Esquiline, and inclosed the seven hills with a line of fortffications, of which one portion is still
traceable. The ridge connecting the Capitoline and Quirinal was a barrier which cut the town in
two. The only means of communication between the two halves of the city, when its population
had reached nearly two million inhabitants, were the narrow strip of land between the Capitoline
aud the river and a lane ten feet wide crossing the ridge. To relieve the pressure, this ridge was cut
away by the Emperor Trajan, in whose Forum on the site of the excavations stands the well-known
‘Trajan's Column,' 140 feet high, ⁴ erected to show to posterity how high was the mountain leveled
by the Emperor.' The business portion of the modern city occupies the Campus Martius, its main
artery. the minous ‘Corso,' following the line of the ancient street shown on the plan. See Lan-
eiani‚ Ancient Rome, p. 86.
