vi PREFA ΟΕ

All vowels known to be long have been carefully marked. The
text of this edition is, in the main, that of C. Holzer (tenth edi-
tion, Stuttgart, 1889). In orthography, however, Brambach has
been followed. In the case of syllables containing vowelslong
by position the editors have followed the views of Anton Marx as·
laid down in his H iilfisbiicldein fiir die Aassprache der Zateim‘schvenv
Vokale in positionwslcmgyen Silben (second edition, Berlin, 1889).
In the vocabulary compound verbs are given under *the simple
verbs as an aid to the fuller appreciation of the methods by
which they are formed and their meanings derived. The exer-
cises in prose composition have been made simple in order that
they may occupy their legitimate place as subordinate and auxil-
iary to the development of the more important reading power.

The thanks of the editors are dne to Mr. Ε. G. WVarner, of the
Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, for his hearty cooperation in the
work, and particularly for the labor which he has expended upon
the exercises.
