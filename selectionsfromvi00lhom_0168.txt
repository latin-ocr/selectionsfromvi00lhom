The star prefixed to certain verbs, e.g. fiigo and speci6, indicates that the verb
was obsolete, i.e. not in ordinary use. Compound verbs are defined under the
simple verbs from which they are derived. To this practice there are, however,
two exceptions: (1) When neither the simple verb nor any other compound
formed from it occurs in the text, and (2) in the case of certain verbs like sfim'fi
and surg‘o', which, though themselves compounds, came to be regarded virtuallyv
as simple verbs and served as the base of further compounds.

The student will therefore save time and labor if he accustoms himself when
reading to analyze compound verbs before consulting the Vocabulary. This
analysis will often make plain the meaning of the compound, and render it
unneeessary to seek the aid of the Vocabulary at all.
