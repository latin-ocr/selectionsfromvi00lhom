This work has been prepared in response to a growing demand for
a new first reading book in Latin, offering more simple and interesting
material for the second-year work than is now provided by Caesar's
Commentaries, the first connected reading pupils meet in the Latin
course.

It is the aim of the present volume to offer for the student’s first
reading in Latin, material in which the least, rather than the more,
difficult Latin comes first; which contains the largest possible general
vocabulary, instead of a small special vocabulary ; which is drawn from
a wide, instead of a narrow, range of literature; and which may be

associated with other departments of teaching with greater success and
⁵ productiveness than Caesar’s Commentaries.

The selections in First Latin Readings have, therefore, been
chosen with reference to their difficulty, their interest as literature, and,
as far as possible, their relation to Roman life and custom, and not with
reference to their exclusive use as drilling material on formal classical
construction.

Exercises in Latin prose composition, based on the text of each
author represented, have been prepared, and are included in the book,
